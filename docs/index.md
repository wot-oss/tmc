Find, use and contribute device descriptions for industrial IoT devices!

The Thing Model Catalog Command Line Client, or ```tmc``` for short, is a tool for browsing, consuming, contributing and serving Thing Models.

Thing Models are simple device descriptions specified in the [W3C Thing Description][1] standard. Thing Models are to Thing Descriptions what classes are to instances in programming languages.

Thing Models let you describe industrial devices using a simple standardized JSON-based format, which is independent of the communication protocol. This enables a uniform access layer to the fragmented industrial protocol landscape we encounter today.

Thing Descriptions are to Modbus, BACnet, MQTT, DNP3 ... what HTML is to HTTP.
